								<h1>Youth Culter Married life</h1>
								<p>Today's youth culture is an ever-changing marathon that leads to the discovery of the actual person, within the shell of a constantly changing teenager. Teenagers often find themselves in the dilemma of searching for their purpose, identity, and destiny in life while balancing relationships with friends and family. This fast-paced Life of an American Teenager requires FUEL for living.
Need FUEL????
We GOT FUEL!
FUEL Student Ministries actively targets those students in grades 6-12. We desire to create an atmosphere that is welcoming to all students regardless of their interests or peer groups. Surrounded by a pop-culture that projects standards of today's youth, we want to help our students gain a full understanding of who they are in Christ and equip them with passion and boldness to be secure in their choices.
FUEL Student Ministries was designed with today's youth in mind -- for the middle school and high school student -- black or white -- male or female -- skater or musician -- football captain or captain of the debate team --we offer something for everyone!
FUEL's primary focus centers around 5 core elements: PRAYER, WORSHIP, DISCIPLESHIP, TANK GROUPS, AND OUTREACH. With these in mind, we strive to see students grow in their knowledge and relationship with God. Teaching spiritual principles that impact practical living, FUEL provides encouragement and support for teenagers as they follow Christ.
Perhaps the whole 'church' idea seems odd to you? Come check us out. We're not your typical "church" youth group. We like being different. Let's face it -- you are unique and so are we, but you'll find a common ground at FUEL, where there is a place for every teen.</p>
